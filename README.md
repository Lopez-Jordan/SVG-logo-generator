# SVG Logo Generator

## Description
In this project you are able to generate a custom logo (shape with 3 letters inside) as an SVG file. Here I practiced using the inquire and jest external dependencies to prompt the user and run tests on my code.

## Installation
To install, you must 1: clone the project, 2: install inquirer by running `node install inquirer@8.2.4` and run `node index.js` to start generating your logo!

## Tests
if you would like to test, you must run `npm install jest` on your command line then run `npm run test`
